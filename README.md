  <i>Full stack web application scaffold,The perfect combination of <b>Refine</b> and <b>BetterCRUD</b></i>
</p>
<hr>

**BlackPanther** is a complete full-stack web application scaffolding that uses FastAPI, BetterCRUD, Refine, and more.
He has defined a set of good front-end and back-end development best practices to quickly develop products such as CRM, CMS, Admin Dashboard and other different types of management systems

I like [Refine](https://refine.dev/) very much, I think it's a good solution for the front-end to produce products quickly, and I have always hoped that Refine can be combined with [BetterCRUD](https://github.com/bigrivi/better_crud) to generate strong productivity, which is also the original intention of this project

Black Panther is the name of a stray cat I feed. It is very cute and obedient. We have a good relationship. My daughter gave it the name, which I think is good. I hope it can live a good life.
